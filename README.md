## Introduction

VolumetricAnalysis_Medicine intends to provide physicians and researchers a greater ability to analyze and describe complex patient anatomy. This tool provides physicians the ability to select an anatomical feature, isolate it from surrounding tissue, and visualize it in 3 dimmensions. The code further allows the user to describe the selected anatomy, such as but not limited to volume, cubic volume, and dimensions.
